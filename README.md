# G52GRP-Aircraft-clone
Testing to see what can be moved on multiple computers


## The prototype: Earth-and-airports:

### Installing dependencies on Linux

#### Ubuntu distros:
`sudo apt install libglfw3-dev`

This should install glfw3 and all its dependencies. The make file should run perfectly.

### Installing dependencies on Mac:
`brew install glfw3`

This has not been tested, but should work- change this text if it has. You may need to install homebrew first.

### Installing dependencies on Windows:


### To run:


`make run`

or

`make`

`./bin/airport-renderer`
